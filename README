== Audio Sockets

This project originally started as an experiment with the Firefox Audio API. Since then the idea has grown with the inclusion of node.js to try to create a live, collaborative audio interface in the browser. I am using the express module here for http requests alongside socket.io for web sockets. The app also makes use of Corban Brook's Digital Signal Processing library, dsp.js. This is used on the client side tohelp process the audio in the browser.


== Browser Compatability

At the time of starting this project I wasn't aware of any other audio APIs available in the browser. Since then it seems that Google have also suggested an audio API implementation for webkit based browsers. Currently this app only works with the Mozilla API version and will therefore only work in Firefox. There are plans in the future however to look into Google's API to see how this works.


== Forking

Please feel free to fork this project as you wish. I have used this project as a way of learning javascript so it wold be great to see how people can extend the app or suggest better ways to carry out the processes involved.
